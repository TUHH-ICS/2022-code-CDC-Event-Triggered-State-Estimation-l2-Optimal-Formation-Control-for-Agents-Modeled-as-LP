# Event-Triggered State-Estimation l2-Optimal Formation Control for Agents Modeled as LPV Systems 

[![DOI]

## General

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithms and simulations described in the paper

>Gerald Gebhardt, Hamideh Saadabadi and Herbert Werner, "Event-Triggered State-Estimation $\ell_2$-Optimal Formation Control 
for Agents Modeled as LPV Systems", submitted to CDC, 2022.

It can be used to recreate and validate the figures from the paper.
To do so, run the file `Main.m`.
The raw data used in the figures in the paper is available in the subdirectory `figures`.

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need a working copy of [*Yalmip*](https://yalmip.github.io/) together with a suitable SDP solver in your *Matlab* path.

The code in this repository was tested in the following environment:

* *Windows 10* Version 20H2
* *Matlab* 2020b
* *Yalmip* 31-March-2021
